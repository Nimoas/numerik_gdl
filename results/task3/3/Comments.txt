On the explicit euler method results:
* The problem seems to be stiff, since the approximations are completely unstable.
* h = 0.001 is the first h to produce usable results.
* All other h either oscilate around the exact result or diverge at some point.
(* That doesn't yet mention h=0.01 where we end at NaNs...)

On the implicit euler methods:
* Implicit methods handle stiff problems much better. Thus all h give usable results.
* Takes a lot longer to compute, esp. if we pick even smaller h.
* Approximation has a phase-difference to the exact solution that corresponds to h.
