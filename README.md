# How to run

* Install a recent stable version of Rust (incl. cargo). Recommended way is via https://rustup.rs/
* Tasks are in the examples folder. You can run one with e.g.
``cargo run --example task01``.
Just replace the task name with the correct filename for the current task.

# Folder layout
* Plots and other images for a task are gnerated in a img_{taskname} folder.
* I'll put the task output along with the generated images into the results folder as well. That way you can look a them without running the tasks.
