# How to run

* Install a recent stable version of Rust (incl. cargo). Recommended way is via https://rustup.rs/
* Tasks are in the exampes folder. You can run one with e.g.
``cargo run --example task01``.
Just replace the task name with the correct filename for the current task.
* Plots and other images for a task are gnerated in a img_{taskname} folder.
